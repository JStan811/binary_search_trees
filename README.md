Most recent commit:

Finished #balance and #rebalance methods. For #balance, I had to get help from the web. I just couldn't get it to work with my current methods. I ended up replacing my #height with one from geeksforgeeks.org and then using some of their #balance method logic in mine as well. #rebalance was much easier - I just grabbed the inorder array from the unbalanced tree then created a new tree using that. I'm not sure if its right though since TOP recommends grabbing the level-order array instead. Finally I created a driver script to test my work in main.rb. In the end, I'm happy with the result of this project. It took me about 8-9 hours of work in total. Huzzah...
